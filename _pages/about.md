Hi and welcome to my website!

I am an assistant professor of instruction in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in [Statistics](https://statistics.rice.edu/) at Rice University, advised by Professor [Meng Li](https://meng.rice.edu/). Before that, I spent four wonderful years at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) and received a B.S. in Probability and Statistics.

I am passionate about statistics, and my research interests span the areas of nonparametrics, variable selection, and symbolic regression.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, climbing, making coffee, and wrenching on cars.
